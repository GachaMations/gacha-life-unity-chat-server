# Gacha Life Unity Chat Server
Server used for the revived Chat feature from Gacha Life in Gacha Life Unity.
Has to be hosted manually as of now, but i'll hopefully have an online server that the game connects to by default.
You'll probably still be able to add custom servers on release, but it will default to the main chat server.

Will probably be updated in the future for performance reasons, and to patch vulnerabilities.
